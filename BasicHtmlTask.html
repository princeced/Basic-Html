			<h2>Re: Eilen Dover university application</h2><br/>

			<p>Dear Eilen,</p><br/>

			<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part </p>
			<p>of your <abbr title="Phd">Phd</abbr> next year.I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p><br/>

			<h3>Starting dates</h3><br/>

			<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time,however it would suit us better if you</p> 
			<p>could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p><br/>
			<ul>
			<li>First Semester: 9 September 2016 </li>
			<li>Second Semester: 15 January 2017</li>
			<li>Third Semester: 2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>
			<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
			<p>You can find more information about <a href="">important university dates</a> on our website.</p></br>

			<h3>Subjects of study</h3><br/>

			<p>&nbsp;At the Awesome Science Faculty,we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjects fall </p>
			<p>&nbsp;somwhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like intelligent,dedicated researcher, and just</p>
			<p>&nbsp;the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intigued</p>
			<p>&nbsp;by are as follows,in order of priority:</p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ol>
			<li>&nbsp;Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benefitsof Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li><br/>
			<li>&nbsp;Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the<br/>
			   &nbsp;audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</li><br/>
			<li>&nbsp;<abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li><br/>
            </ol>
			<p>&nbsp;So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd except the </p>
			<p>&nbsp;research to take,required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p><br/>

			<h3>&nbsp;Exotic dance moves</h3><br/>

			<p>&nbsp;Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did </i>study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,</p>
			<p>&nbsp;my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p><br/>

			<p>&nbsp;Polynesian chicken dance</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little known  but <i>very </i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitfull".</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which </p>
			 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly</p>
			 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired </p>
			 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modern styles such as Tweerking.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;Arctic robot dance</p>
			 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960s believed to have </p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this </p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they were really cold.</p><br/>

			<p>&nbsp;For more of my research, see my <a href="">exotic dance research page.</a></p><br/>

			<p>&nbsp;Yours sincerely,</p><br/>

			<p>&nbsp;Dr Eleanor Gaye</p><br/>
